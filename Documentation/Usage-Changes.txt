Function Editor Changes:

- The #-prefix, for running a command only a single time even if "Do all files"
  is checked, now works with internal commands.

- A new &-prefix for internal commands forces the command to run in asynchronous
  mode even if "Run asynchronously" is not enabled.
  This MUST ONLY be used on the last command in the function, no other commands
  of any type can follow this command.
  It can be combined with the #-prefix if the #-prefix comes first.
  At the moment of writhing, only XADOpen needs this.

  It makes Functions like this (useless) example possible:
    AmigaDOS    C:Copy Work:somefile.lha RAM:
    AmigaDOS    C:Rename RAM:somfile.lha RAM:otherfile.lha
    Command     &XADOpen RAM:otherfile.lha

- Experienced users might have noticed the lack of a "Command FinishSection"
  line in the example above.
  The need for this command to make the the function run "in order" when mixing
  "Command" with "AmigaDos"/"Workbench"/"Script"/"ARexx" is counter-intuitive.
  For this reason the functionality of this command is made automatic each
  time a "Command" follows one of the other types, and the command itself is
  removed.


Command Changes:

- Copy, CopyAs, Encrypt, MakeLink and MakeLinkAs are no longer multi-destination.
  The new commands MultiCopy, MultiCopyAs, MultiEncrypt, MultiMakeLink and
  MultiMakeLinkAs preserves the original behavior.

- XADOpen and XADExtract have new commandline options.
  For XADopen they are:
       	ARCHIVE	    Filename of archive to open with full path.
                    If supplied selected files in source Listers are ignored.
                    Implies "NEWLISTER".
        NEWLISTER/S Open in new Lister Window.
                    If not supplied the current Source/Active Window is used.
  And for XADExtract:
       	ARCHIVE/M   Filename(s) of archive(s) to extract.
                    If supplied selected files in source Listers are ignored.
        TO/K        Destination directory.
                    If supplied any destination Listers present will be ignored.

- FinishSection is removed. see note in "Function Editor Changes" above.

- DiskInfo is removed and its functionality integrated into IconInfo
  command.


LoadGB Changes:

- The qualifier for fallback to LoadWB is changed to the Amiga keys.

- Updated to support pass-trough of all LoadWB arguments as of LoadWB version
  47.1.

- The Listers got a new path-gadget to replace the old string-gadget. Some
  editing keys have changed functions, supported editing keys are now:
