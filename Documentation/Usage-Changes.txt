Function Editor Changes:

- Made #-prefix, for running a command only a single time even if "Do all files"
  is checked, work with internal commands.

Command Changes:

- Copy, CopyAs, Encrypt, MakeLink and MakeLinkAs are no longer multi-destination.
  The new commands MultiCopy, MultiCopyAs, MultiEncrypt, MultiMakeLink and
  MultiMakeLinkAs preserves the orignal behaviour.
