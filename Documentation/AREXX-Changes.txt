The prefix for AREXX scripts is changed to ".galileo"

The AREXX port name is changed to "GALILEO.x", where x is the instance number
of the program (usually 1).

The "dopus" commands has been renamed to "galileo".

The command "lister query" has a new argument:
"lister query <handle> sourcedestlock"
This returns "1" if the lister is locked as either a source or a destination
lister, or "0" otherwise.

The command "lister clear" has a new argument:
"lister clear <handle> handler"
It clears a Custom Handler previously set with "lister set <handle> handler".

There is no longer a global 255 character path-length limit, if you ask for the
path of a lister it can be of any length.
For this reason the "lister" command has has a new argument:
"lister assign <handle> <option>"
Where option can be one of "get" and "free".
"get" will make a temporary assign to the lister current-directory in the
format "garx_00000000:", where '0' represents a hex digit.
And "free" will un-assign it. These assigns are filtered out when viewing the
DeviceList in Lister-windows.
