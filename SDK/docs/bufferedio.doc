    NAME
        CloseBuf - close a buffered file

    SYNOPSIS
        CloseBuf(file)
                  A0

        long CloseBuf(APTR);

    FUNCTION
        Closes a file opened with OpenBuf().

    INPUTS
        file - file to close

    RESULT
        Any write data in the buffer is written to disk and the
        file is closed. If the return value is less than zero, this
        indicates there was an error writing the last chunk of data
        to the file.

    NAME
        ExamineBuf - Examine an open file

    SYNOPSIS
        ExamineBuf(file, fib)
                    A0    A1

        long ExamineBuf(APTR, struct FileInfoBlock *);

    FUNCTION
        This function calls ExamineFH() on the underlying DOS file handle.

    INPUTS
        file - file to examine
        fib - FileInfoBlock structure, must be longword aligned

    RESULT
        Returns DOSTRUE if successful. The FileInfoBlock will contain
        information about the open file.

    BUGS
        If the file is open for writing, the file size reported by this
        function may not be accurate.

    NAME
        FHFromBuf - get DOS file handle

    SYNOPSIS
        FHFromBuf(file)
                   A0

        BPTR FHFromBuf(APTR);

    FUNCTION
        This function returns the underlying DOS file handle for a
        buffered IO handle.

    INPUTS
        file - buffered IO file handle

    RESULT
        Returns the file handle.

    NAME
        FlushBuf - flush file buffer

    SYNOPSIS
        FlushBuf(file)
                  A0

        long FlushBuf(APTR);

    FUNCTION
        This function flushes the buffer of a buffered IO file. If there
        is any write data in the buffer, it is written to disk.
        If the return value is less than zero, this indicates there was an
	error writing the last chunk of data to the file.

    INPUTS
        file - file handle to flush

    RESULT
        The buffer is flushed.

    NOTES
        In practice, you never need to call this function.

    NAME
        OpenBuf - open a file for buffered I/O

    SYNOPSIS
        OpenBuf(name, mode, bufsize)
                 A0    D0     D1

        APTR OpenBuf(char *, long, long);

    FUNCTION
        This function opens a file for use with the buffered I/O routines.

    INPUTS
        name - name of the file to open
        mode - mode to use
        bufsize - size of the buffer to use

    RESULT
        Returns a buffered file handle if successful, or NULL. This is
        not a standard DOS file handle, and can only be used with the
        other buffered IO functions.

    NAME
        ReadBuf - read data from a buffered file

    SYNOPSIS
        ReadBuf(file, buffer, size)
                 A0     A1     D0

        long ReadBuf(APTR, char *, long);

    FUNCTION
        This function reads data from a buffered IO file.

    INPUTS
        file - buffered IO file handle
        buffer - buffer to place data in
        size - size to read

    RESULT
        This function returns the size of the data actually read,
        or -1 if an error occurred.

    NAME
        ReadBufLine - read a line of input from a buffered file

    SYNOPSIS
        ReadBufLine(file, buffer, size)
                     A0     A1     D0

        long ReadBufLine(APTR, char *, long);

    FUNCTION
        This function reads data from a buffered IO file, up until the
        first newline character (or the buffer is full). It is similar to
        the fgets() standard C function.

    INPUTS
        file - buffered IO file handle
        buffer - buffer to place data in
        size - size to read

    RESULT
        This function returns the size of the data actually read,
        or -1 if an error occurred.

    NAME
        SeekBuf - seek within a buffered IO file

    SYNOPSIS
        SeekBuf(file, offset, mode)
                 A0     D0     D1

        long SeekBuf(APTR, long, long);

    FUNCTION
        This function sets the read/write position for a buffered IO file.
        If the seek takes the position outside of the current buffer, the
        buffer will be flushed and re-read automatically.

    INPUTS
        file - file to seek within
        offset - offset to seek
        mode - type of seet (OFFSET_BEGINNING, OFFSET_CURRENT, OFFSET_END)

    RESULT
        Returns the previous file position.

    INPUTS
        file - file handle
        data - data to write
