    NAME
        OpenDisk - open a disk for direct I/O

    SYNOPSIS
        OpenDisk(disk, port)
                  A0    A1

        DiskHandle *OpenDisk(char *, struct MsgPort *);

    FUNCTION
        This routine makes it easy to access the underlying device for
        direct I/O. It allows you to open any filesystem (that supports
        direct I/O) with just the device name.

    INPUTS
        disk - name of disk to open, eg DF0:, HD1:
        port - message port to use, or NULL

    RESULT
        If this function succeeds, it returns a DiskHandle structure,
        which contains all the information you need to access the device
        directly. The structure fields are :

            dh_Port
                If you did not supply a message port to use, one is
                created automatically and its address is stored here. Usually
                you will want a port created for you, but if you are working
                with multiple devices at once you might want them all to share
                the same message port.

            dh_IO
                This is a pointer to an IOExtTD structure, which you can use
                to perform I/O on the device.

            dh_Startup
                A pointer to the FileSysStartupMsg of the device.

            dh_Geo
                A pointer to the DosEnvec structure of the device.

            dh_Device
                Full device name (without a colon)

            dh_Info/dh_Result
                If dh_Result is TRUE, dh_Info is valid, and contains current
                information about the disk.

            dh_Root/dh_BlockSize
                These give the block number of the disk's root block, and
                the block size.

    NAME
        CloseDisk - close a DiskHandle structure

    SYNOPSIS

        with the OpenDisk() routine.

    INPUTS
        handle - DiskHandle to close
