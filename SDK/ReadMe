The Galileo SDK kit allows you to access the functions in the galileofm.library,
and create your own modules, applications or other programs that use the
power of Galileo.

The contents of the SDK is as follows :

	docs        - Documentation for the galileofm.library
	include	    - Include files
	lib         - Linker files (The contents of this directory gets generated
                      while running the "buildme" scipt)
	example     - Example source code
	source      - Source to the modinit.o module (The contents of this directroy
                      gets generated while running the "buildme" scipt)

The include and linker files are all designed for use with a C compiler
(the example source code is set up to compile under SAS/C).

The examples that have been included are :

	module		- A basic module that adds one command to Galileo and
                          opens a requester. Shows a simple example of
                          creating an Galileo gfmmodule.

	envoymodule	- A module that lets you set network information for
	                  files with Envoy. Shows an example of a simple
	                  user interface, using the Galileo callback function
	                  and using a progress indicator.

	iconclock	- The source to the icon clock module. Shows how to
	                  write a module that is called on startup and remains
	                  resident. Also has an example of the new AppIcon
	                  features of Galileo.

	viewfont	- The source to the ViewFont program. Shows how to
	                  create a more complex, resizeable user interface,
	                  and how to access menus.
