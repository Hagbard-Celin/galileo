The main program icon comes from the "Roman's Magic WB Icons 3"-pack by Roman Patzner found at:
http://aminet.net/package/pix/mwb/RomIcons3

Due to my lack of artistic skill, the other icons are to various degree based-on/inspired-by
a low resolution render in Blender.
Before the folloing requierd credit, I must state: The absymal quality of the result is entirly
my fault.
