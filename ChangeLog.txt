Galileo - ChangeLog
----------------------------
 10-Dec-23 Hagbard Celine (ver 0.1 - initial GitHub upload)

      - Changed all versions to 0 and all revision to 1.

      - Partly cleaned up source directory removing many unused/redundant files.

      - Fixed muforce it in Program/lister_window.c when running some commands after closing
        all previously open listers.

      - Added support for IECLASS_POINTERPOS in Program/cx.c. Fixes popup-menus over inactive
        windows in WinUAE with "Install virtual mouse driver" enabled.

      - Made the directory where the archive resides become parent of the archive root in
        XADbrowser if using XADOpen without NEWLISTER.

      - Added commandline switch NEWLISTER/S to XADOpen. It will now open in a new lister
        if this switch is specified, and takeover the originating lister if not.

      - Added callback function gc_issourcedestlock and corresponding AREXX command
        "lister query <handle> sourcedestlock" to check if a lister is locked either as
        source or destination lister.

      - Made XADOpen not set the originating lister as destination if any other destination
        lister exists.

      - Fixed XADExtract refreshing of destination opening extra window.

      - Removed MEMF_CLEAR from memFlags of CreatePool() in Library/memory.c to avoid triple
        clearing of allocated memory, as it is already cleared manually in L_AllocMemH().
        Ref. exec.library/CreatePool autodoc.

      - Adjusted command launch code so commands from .gfmmodules can detach from parent
        lister if "Run Asynchronously" is selected in function-editor.
        See Documentation/Module-Changes.txt for more detail.

      - Imported various fixes by Mathias Heyer with permission.

      - Converted all incarnations of Copy command to single destination, and created new
        multi-destination versions of them all. Changed the prefix of multi-destination
        commands to "Multi", as opposed to "MultiDest".

      - Replaced the animation in about-requester, and moved the remapping to before the
        window opens. Yes it looks bad, but I had to get rid of the trademarked logo. Because
        the new anim is much bigger than the original, the Easter-egg had to go.

      - Removed NameFromLock() totally from entered paths in Environment->Paths. In addition to
        reported problems with assigns, the same issues would show up for links.

      - Fixed drag'n'drop breakage due to me changing the copy command to single-destination.

      - Adjusted Forbid()/Permit() in Library/pathlist.c so our search places do not quit on us.

      - Added Forbid()/Permit() around more FindTask() calls. No more PatchWork hits (hopefully).

      - Made XADbrowser set date, protection bits and comment on extracted files/directories.

      - Disabled support for multiple destinations in "Copy" and "CopyAs" commands. The
        functionality did not play well with command trapping by arexx-scripts/gfmmodules.
        Made new commands "MultiDestCopy" and "MultiDestCopyAS" that preserves the
        original behavior.

      - Fixed MuForce hit when having multiple XADbrowser windows open.

      - Fixed file-list sent to arexx-scripts/gfmmodules when "Preform all actions on icons" is
        selected. It would skip all files directly following any ".info" file in the list.

      - Made "DOUNTO" icon never try to access filenames that do not exist in the current buffer.

      - Fixed discrepancies in handling of "DOUNTO" icon flags.

      - Fixed runaway opencount for main library when changing screenmode.

      - Removed double close of locale.library in Library:libinit.c

      - Added checks before closing optional libraries.

      - Fixed MuForce hit due to uninitialized pointer in XADbrowser.
        This also fixes ProgressWindow for XADbrowser.

      - Made XADbrowser abort operation when you click the abort button on error
        requester.

      - Plugged memory leaks in:
        *Library/ipc.c
        *Program/toolbar.c
        *Program/cleanup.c
        *Program/event_loop.c
        *Program/environment.c
        *Library/images.c (x2)
        *Program/backdrop_drag.c (Thanks to Mathias Heyer for the correct fix)
        *Library/drag_routines.c (Thanks to Mathias Heyer for the correct fix)
        *Modules/Config/lister_menu.c
        *Modules/Config/config_menus_edit.c
        *Modules/XADbrowser/XADbrowser.c
        (Important parts commented "// Plug memory leak" for convenient replication)

      - Adjusted OpenScreen() call to not use saved resolution/depth when cloning Workbench.

      - Enabled off-screen window dragging.

      - Fixed ScreenMode selector logic to behave more like Prefs/ScreenMode.

      - No assigns needed before starting¹, changed most internal references to assigned dir
        to "PROGDIR:".
        External tools might still need assigns to find us, so if not present they will be
        created on startup and removed on quit.
        ¹Workbench replacement mode still needs the "Galileo:" assign.

      - Removed need for "path add" of our C directory in User-Startup. It will be added the
        head of our own pathlists on creation.
        This is done without any checks preformed, so "PROGDIR:C" MUST exist. 

      - Finished name change to Galileo. Went for the nuclear option and changed everything from
        main-program/library/module names to internal variables and the FORM id for config files.
        We are now officially incompatible with both original and APL version. Locales where
        already incompatible by this point.
        The upside is that we can now exist in parallel with installed original/APL version
        without crashing the users Amiga.

      - Made a simple converter, "IFFtoGalileo", for config files that changes the FORM id.
        Mostly meant for  converting your old configured filetypes, but works for all config
        files, until it doesn't.

      - Added DOS\6 and DOS\7 to format.gfmmodule.

      - Fixed format.gfmmodule disabling of DOS\3-DOS\7 on older OS.

      - Added DOS\6, DOS\7, SFS\0 and SFS\2 to filesystem-detection in icon.gfmmodule and
        diskinfo.gfmmodule

      - Disabled Hidden-bit functionality as the protection-bit stands for Hold.
        TODO: Check if this affects FTP dotfile hiding.

      - Added Hold- and Pure-bit to icon-information window.

      - Changed XADbrowser to check if archive is password protected, and if so ask for password
        _before_ trying to extract any files. Gets rid of the additional error requester before
        password requester. 

      - Completely cleaned out (hopefully) all obsolete/removed/unused functions from main library
        and config.gfmmodule.

      - Removed all remnants of registration/serial/pirate-check code.

      - Removed the changelog for time before open-source release from "source/Program/version.c",
        and put it in a new file named "ChangeLog_Historical.txt"

      - Changed XADbrowser to compile with same includes as other integrated modules(mostly).

      - Fix for XADbrowser bug where it choked on directories with similar names.

      - Imported XAD password support code by Szilard Biro from APL
        version with permission, and fixed it to compile on SAS/C.

      - Changed RTG includes from Cybergraphics to P96. P96 is now required for RTG.

      - Included original XADopus source from Aminet, renamed as XADbrowser.

      - Updated XADmaster include files, minimum version of xadmaster.library is now "13.0".

      - Made some rudimentary fixes to XADbrowser internal error handling. 

      - Changed config, ftp, and XADbrowser to build form same "smakefile" as other modules.

      - Fixed compiling on SAS/C to the point where it builds and starts. Includes registration
        check removal among other fixes by Roman Kargin <kas1e@yandex.ru> and
        Szilard Biro imported from the APL version with permission.

      - Updated to AmigaOS 3.2 includes.

      - Changed the name in (hopefully) all strings in the GUI.

      - Deleted the Documents directory as there is no chance I will be able to to keep the PDFs
        updated in addition to the Amigaguide and the SDK.

  7-Aug-23 Hagbard Celine

   	  - Forked from "SVN Trunk commit 16" at "https://sourceforge.net/p/dopus5allamigas/code/16/tree/"
        and changed name to Galileo.

  * makefile: renamed all "makefile" files to "smakefile" to make it more clear
    that these are SAS/C makefiles and no GCC makefiles and make room for the
    upcoming GCC makefiles.

2012-12-12 Roman Kargin <kas1e@yandex.ru>

  * Dopus5 code uses MsgPort->mp_Flags for some private flag (PF_ASYNC) for IPC
    communications and which is defined as "#define PF_ASYNC    (1<<7)". While
    on OS3 and MorphOS it wasn't a problem, its still was hardcode/hardcore and
    bring conflicts in AmigaOS4 (which causes heavy crashes), because on AmigaOS4
    such a define are taken for private messaging needs and defined as PF_SIGALLOC 
    (check exec/ports.h in OS4's SDK).
    
    So we get rid of the hardcoding, and do changes to not mess with MsgPort->mp_Flags,
    but instead make it put (and check) some magic value in MsgPort->mp_Node.ln_Pri
    (may be possible with MsgPort->mp_Node.ln_Type as well).
    
    The changes are quite small:
    
    initial dopus5 code:
    
    # find -type f | xargs grep -i PF_ASYNC
    
     ./Program/function_launch.c:    handle->reply_port->mp_Flags|=PF_ASYNC;
     ./Library/ipc.c:                if (reply->mp_Flags&PF_ASYNC)
     ./Library/ipc.c:                port->mp_Flags|=PF_ASYNC;
     ./Library/dopusbase.h:#define PF_ASYNC  (1<<7)
     ./NewRegModules/dopusbase.h:#define PF_ASYNC    (1<<7)

    our new changes:

    ./Program/function_launch.c:    handle->reply_port->mp_Node.ln_Pri = PORT_ASYNC_MAGIC;
    ./Library/ipc.c:                if (reply->mp_Node.ln_Pri == PORT_ASYNC_MAGIC)
    ./Library/ipc.c:                port->mp_Node.ln_Pri = PORT_ASYNC_MAGIC;
    ./Library/dopusbase.h:#define PORT_ASYNC_MAGIC  0x5A
    ./NewRegModules/dopusbase.h:#define PORT_ASYNC_MAGIC 0x5A
      
     By this way we didn't have any conflicts with any private parts of any OS and avoid
     hardcoding to make whole code more portable in end. 

     Thanks to the AROS core coder "Georg Steger", who help to find out the roots.

2012-12-22 Jens Langner <Jens.Langner@light-speed.de>

  * ChangeLog, README, etc.: added ChangeLog file to synchronize individual
    developer changes more easily.

2012-12-18 Roman Kargin <kas1e@yandex.ru>

  * initial checkin of open sourced sources.
